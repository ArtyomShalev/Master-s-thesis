	Abstract = {High-index III-V semiconductor nanoantennas have gained great attention for enhanced nonlinear light-matter interactions, in the past few years. However, the complexity of nonlinear emission profiles imposes severe constraints on practical applications, such as in optical communications and integrated optoelectronic devices. These complexities include the lack of unidirectional nonlinear emission and the severe challenges in switching between forward and backward emissions, due to the structure of the susceptibility tensor of the III-V nanoantennas. Here, we propose a solution to both issues via engineering the nonlinear tensor of the nanoantennas. The special nonlinear tensorial properties of zinc-blende material can be used to engineer the nonlinear characteristics via growing the nanoantennas along different crystalline orientations. Based on the nonlinear multipolar effect, we have designed and fabricated (110)-grown GaAs nanoantennas, with engineered tensorial properties, embedded in a transparent low-index material. Our technique provides an approach not only for unidirectional second-harmonic generation (SHG) forward or backward emission but also for switching from one to another. Importantly, switching the SHG emission directionality is obtained only by rotating the polarization of the incident light, without the need for physical variation of the antennas or the environment. This characteristic is an advantage, as compared to other nonlinear nanoantennas, including (100)- and (111)-grown III-V counterparts or silicon and germanium nanoantennas. Indeed, (110)-GaAs nanoantennas allow for engineering the nonlinear nanophotonic systems including nonlinear "Huygens metasurfaces" and offer exciting opportunities for various nonlinear nanophotonics technologies, such as nanoscale light routing and light sources, as well as multifunctional flat optical elements.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Nonradiating electromagnetic configurations in nanostructures open new horizons for applications due to two essential features: lack of energy losses and invisibility to the propagating electromagnetic field. Such radiationless configurations form a basis for new types of nanophotonic devices, where a strong electromagnetic field confinement can be achieved together with lossless interactions between nearby components. In our work, we present a new design of free-standing disk nanoantennas with nonradiating current distributions for the optical near-infrared range. We show a novel approach to create nanoantennas by slicing III-V nanowires into standing disks using focused ion beam milling. We experimentally demonstrate the suppression of the far-field radiation and the associated strong enhancement of the second-harmonic generation from the disk nanoantennas. With a theoretical analysis of the electromagnetic field distribution using multipole expansions in both spherical and Cartesian coordinates, we confirm that the demonstrated nonradiating configurations are anapoles. We expect that the presented procedure to design and produce disk nanoantennas from nanowires become one of standard approaches to fabricate controlled chains of standing nanodisks with different designs and configurations. These chains can be an essential building blocks for new types of lasers and sensors with low power consumption.},

	Abstract = {Subwavelength optical resonators made of high-index dielectric materials provide efficient ways to manipulate light at the nanoscale through mode interferences and enhancement of both electric and magnetic fields. Such Mie-resonant dielectric structures have low absorption, and their functionalities are limited predominantly by radiative losses. We implement a new physical mechanism for suppressing radiative losses of individual nanoscale resonators to engineer special modes with high quality factors: optical bound states in the continuum (BICs). We demonstrate that an individual subwavelength dielectric resonator hosting a BIC mode can boost nonlinear effects increasing second-harmonic generation efficiency. Our work suggests a route to use subwavelength high-index dielectric resonators for a strong enhancement of light--matter interactions with applications to nonlinear optics, nanoscale lasers, quantum photonics, and sensors.},

We employ amorphous silicon nanodisks to achieve strong self-modulation of femtosecond pulses with a depth of 60{\%} at picojoule-per-disk pump energies. In the pump-probe measurements, we reveal that switching in the nanodisks can be governed by pulse-limited 65 fs-long two-photon absorption being enhanced by a factor of 80 with respect to the unstructured silicon film. We also show that undesirable free-carrier effects can be suppressed by a proper spectral positioning of the magnetic resonance, making such a structure the fastest all-optical switch operating at the nanoscale.},

	Abstract = {Free from phase-matching constraints, plasmonic metasurfaces have contributed significantly to the control of optical nonlinearity and enhancement of nonlinear generation efficiency by engineering subwavelength meta-atoms. However, high dissipative losses and inevitable thermal heating limit their applicability in nonlinear nanophotonics. All-dielectric metasurfaces, supporting both electric and magnetic Mie-type resonances in their nanostructures, have appeared as a promising alternative to nonlinear plasmonics. High-index dielectric nanostructures, allowing additional magnetic resonances, can induce magnetic nonlinear effects, which, along with electric nonlinearities, increase the nonlinear conversion efficiency. In addition, low dissipative losses and high damage thresholds provide an extra degree of freedom for operating at high pump intensities, resulting in a considerable enhancement of the nonlinear processes. We discuss the current state of the art in the intensely developing area of all-dielectric nonlinear nanostructures and metasurfaces, including the role of Mie modes, Fano resonances, and anapole moments for harmonic generation, wave mixing, and ultrafast optical switching. Furthermore, we review the recent progress in the nonlinear phase and wavefront control using all-dielectric metasurfaces. We discuss techniques to realize all-dielectric metasurfaces for multifunctional applications and generation of second-order nonlinear processes from complementary metal--oxide--semiconductor-compatible materials.},

	Abstract = {Steering incident light into specific directions at the nanoscale is very important for future nanophotonics applications of signal transmission and detection. A prerequisite for such a purpose is the development of nanostructures with high-efficiency unidirectional light scattering properties. Here, from both theoretical and experimental sides, we conceived and demonstrated the unidirectional visible light scattering behaviors of a heterostructure, Janus dimer composed of gold and silicon nanospheres. By carefully adjusting the sizes and spacings of the two nanospheres, the Janus dimer can support both electric and magnetic dipole modes with spectral overlaps and comparable strengths. The interference of these two modes gives rise to the narrow-band unidirectional scattering behaviors with enhanced forward scattering and suppressed backward scattering. The directionality can further be improved by arranging the dimers into one-dimensional chain structures. In addition, the dimers also show remarkable electromagnetic field enhancements. These results will be important not only for applications of light emitting devices, solar cells, optical filters, and various surface enhanced spectroscopies but also for furthering our understanding on the light?matter interactions at the nanoscale.},

According to theoretical predictions based on Mie theory they can exhibit strong magnetic resonances in the visible spectral range. The basic mechanism of excitation of such modes inside the nanoparticles is very similar to that of split-ring resonators, but with one important difference that silicon nanoparticles have much smaller losses and are able to shift the magnetic resonance wavelength down to visible frequencies. We experimentally demonstrate for the first time that these nanoparticles have strong magnetic dipole resonance, which can be continuously tuned throughout the whole visible spectrum varying particle size and visually observed by means of dark-field optical microscopy.

Examples of recent advances are microscopic lasers that can reach the diffraction limit, based on photonic crystals, metal-clad cavities and nanowires. However, such lasers are restricted, both in optical mode size and physical device dimension, to being larger than half the wavelength of the optical field, and it remains a key fundamental challenge to realize ultracompact lasers that can directly generate coherent optical fields at the nanometre scale, far beyond the diffraction limit. A way of addressing this issue is to make use of surface plasmons, which are capable of tightly localizing light, but so far ohmic losses at optical frequencies have inhibited the realization of truly nanometre-scale lasers based on such approaches. A recent theoretical work predicted that such losses could be significantly reduced while maintaining ultrasmall modes in a hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Here we report the experimental demonstration of nanometre-scale plasmonic lasers, generating optical modes a hundred times smaller than the diffraction limit. We realize such lasers using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide consisting of a high-gain cadmium sulphide semiconductor nanowire, separated from a silver surface by a 5-nm-thick insulating gap. Direct measurements of the emission lifetime reveal a broad-band enhancement of the nanowire's exciton spontaneous emission rate by up to six times owing to the strong mode confinement and the signature of apparently threshold-less lasing. Because plasmonic modes have no cutoff, we are able to demonstrate downscaling of the lateral dimensions of both the device and the optical mode. Plasmonic lasers thus offer the possibility of exploring extreme interactions between light and matter, opening up new avenues in the fields of active photonic circuits, bio-sensing and quantum information technology.},

	Abstract = {We show enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) from a hybrid metal−dielectric nanodimer consisting of an inorganic perovskite nano-particle of barium titanate (BaTiO 3) coupled to a metallic gold (Au) nanoparticle. BaTiO 3 −Au nanodimers of 100 nm/80 nm sizes are fabricated by sequential capillarity-assisted particle assembly. The BaTiO 3 nanoparticle has a non-centrosymmetric crystalline structure and generates bulk SHG. We use the localized surface plasmon resonance of the gold nanoparticle to enhance the SHG from the BaTiO 3 nanoparticle. We experimentally measure the nonlinear signal from assembled nanodimers and demonstrate an up to 15-fold enhancement compared to a single BaTiO 3 nanoparticle. We further perform numerical simulations of the linear and SHG spectra of the BaTiO 3 −Au nanodimer and show that the gold nanoparticle acts as a nanoantenna at the SHG wavelength. KEYWORDS: Hybrid nanodimers, second-harmonic generation (SHG), nanophotonics, perovskite, capillary assembly S econd-harmonic generation (SHG) from nanoscale structures is highly important for applications in optical communication, 1 biosensing, 2 bioimaging, 3−7 and control of laser beams. 8 As the nonlinear effects are normally weak and depend strongly on volume, methods to enhance the conversion efficiency are highly desirable. For instance, nanoantennas are proposed to enhance the nonlinear response. 9 Among those, plasmonic nanoantennas are commonly considered 10,11 as a strong source of SHG signal. However, they have high losses in the visible range. Moreover, due to the symmetry of crystalline structure of noble metals, metallic nanoantennas demonstrate SHG owing only to broken symmetry at the surface, 10,12 or to higher-order multipole resonance effects. 13 Therefore, nanoantennas based on dielectric high-refractive-index materials 14 with high intrinsic nonlinear properties are of particular interest in nonlinear nanophotonics. Their SHG and third-harmonic generation (THG) signal can be resonantly enhanced by the Mie resonances 15 typical of semiconductors 16−21 and dielectric 22,23},

	Abstract = {We combine the field confinement of plasmonics with the flexibility of multiple Mie resonances by bottom-up assembly of hybrid metal-dielectric nanodimers. We investigate the electromagnetic coupling between nanoparticles in heterodimers consisting of gold and barium titanate (BaTiO 3 or BTO) nanoparticles through nonlinear second-harmonic spectroscopy and polarimetry. The overlap of the localized surface plasmon resonant dipole mode of the gold nanoparticle with the dipole and higher-order Mie resonant modes in the BTO nanoparticle lead to the formation of hybridized modes in the visible spectral range. We employ the pick-and-place technique to construct the hybrid nanodimers with controlled diameters by positioning the nanoparticles of different types next to each other under a scanning electron microscope. Through linear scattering spectroscopy, we observe the formation of hybrid modes in the nanodimers. We show that the modes can be directly accessed by measuring the dependence of the second-harmonic generation (SHG) signal on the polarization and wavelength of the pump. We reveal both experimentally and theoretically that the hybridization of plasmonic and Mie-resonant modes leads to a strong reshaping of the SHG polarization dependence in the nanodimers, which depends on the pump wavelength. We compare the SHG signal of each hybrid nanodimer with the SHG signal of single BTO nanoparticles to estimate the enhancement factor due to the resonant mode coupling within the nanodimers. We report up to 2 orders of magnitude for the SHG signal enhancement compared with isolated BTO nanoparticles.},

	Abstract = {Although nonlinear optical responses with high refractive index dielectric nanostructures benefit from the large mode volume of the Mie resonances, it is an obstacle to achieve ultra-compact devices compared with plasmonic nanostructures. Besides that, the nonlinear emissions for dielectric nanoparticles often possess complex multipolar contributions, which is not favorable for nonlinear far-field manipulating such as beam steering. This study numerically demonstrates that with the formation of mode-matching condition, the efficiency of second-harmonic generation with an Au/AlGaAs/Au hybridized sandwich nanodisk can be enhanced by two orders compared with a same size AlGaAs nanoparticle, and the mode volume is reduced by about two orders at the same time. What is more interesting is that the nonlinear sources and far-field scattering are tailored by the hybridized resonances, where an ideal magnetic (or electric) dipole scattering around a broadband spectral range is observed for the second-harmonic generation, which provides a reliable way to generate pure magnetic light and to manipulate the nonlinear far-field emissions. The realization of enhanced nonlinear efficiency, the reduced mode volume, the background-free responses, and the ideal magnetic/electric dipole scattering make the sandwich hybridized nanoparticle a promising platform for nonlinear nanophotonics.},

In addition to enabling novel functionalities, EDOF lenses can alleviate the need for stringent alignment requirements for imaging systems. Existing designs, however, are often inefficient or produce an asymmetric point spread function (PSF) that blurs images. Inverse design of nanophotonics, including metasurfaces, has generated strong interest in recent years owing to its potential for generating exotic and innovative optical elements, which are generally difficult to design based on intuition alone. Using adjoint optimization-based inverse electromagnetic design, in this paper, we designed a cylindrical metasurface lens operating at ∼625 nm with a depth of focus exceeding that of an ordinary lens. We validated our design by nanofabrication and optical characterization of silicon nitride metasurface lenses (with a lateral dimension of 66.66 $\mu$m) with three different focal lengths (66.66, 100, and 133.33 $\mu$m). The focusing efficiencies of the fabricated extended depth of focus metasurface lenses are similar to those of traditional metalenses.},

In this contribution, we study the mode coupling in a hybrid dimer with rigorous dipole--dipole interaction theory and explore its potential in fluorescence enhancement. We first discovered that the direct coupling between metal surface--plasmon resonance and dielectric electric--dipole mode creates a hybridized mode due to the strong electric--electric dipole--dipole interaction between the constituent nanoparticles, whereas the dielectric magnetic--dipole mode can only indirectly couple to the plasmons on the basis of the induced electric--magnetic dipole--dipole interaction.

	Abstract = {with high precision. These requirements are strong limiting factors for the fabrication of asymmetric (not a core--shell structure) hybrid nanostructures with certain optical properties. For example, the highthroughput wetchemistry preparation can hardly be applied for fabrication of hybrid nanostructures with precise control of optical properties, especially, based on highindex dielectric materials (Si, GaAs, etc.). [ 9,26 ] Laser ablation also gives random size distributions for the hybrid nanostructures. [ 11 ] Therefore, multistage lithography [ 12,23,27 ] seems to be the most powerful tool to achieve desirable overlapping of the optical modes. However, due to the abovementioned specifi c requirements on the size/position of the individual components, conventional lithography still suffers from the absence of fl exibility. Femtosecond (fs) laser melting at the nanoscale is proven to be an effective method for reshaping of plasmonic nanoparticles. [ 28--33 ] As the direction of the meltinginduced reshaping process is oriented from nanodiscs to nanospheres due to irreversible action of the surface tension, the plasmon resonance is to be shifted to shorter wavelengths. However, fslaser melting has not been applied for modifi cation of hybrid nanostructures. In this work, we demonstrate for the fi rst time a novel costeffective approach for the fabrication of ordered hybrid nanostructures consisting of femtosecond laser reshaping of metal-- dielectric nanoparticles prepared via developed litho graphy methods. The lithographic stages provide a special shape of the dielectric component to achieve controllable modifi cation, preserving both the electric and magnetic optical Mietype resonances, whereas local laser melting of individual hybrid nanoparticles allows selective reshaping of only the metal component without affecting the dielectric one. The presented method enables not only fabrication of a novel type of nonsymmetrical hybrid nanostructures, but also the tailoring of their magnetic and electric optical resonances. In particular, we demonstrate that the laser reshaping of a gold nanoparticle in an Au/Si nanodimer dramatically changes the optical properties of the hybrid nanostructures. The proposed approach has a strong advantage over simple macroscopic heating owing to the possibility of highprecision modifi cation of hybrid nanostructures. We have fabricated the arrays of hybrid nanodimers and applied femtosecond laser modifi cation for tuning of optical properties of both the whole array and individual nanodimers. First of all, the arrays of hybrid nanodimers (a gold nanodisc placed on the top of a truncated silicon nanocone) were produced by means of a combination of ebeam lithography, metal evaporation, liftoff procedure, gasphase chemical etching, and fslaser irradiation as shown in Figure 1 .

In particular, in terms of application to molecular science, broadband ultraviolet frequency-entangled photons are desired because molecules inducing photochemical reactions of interest often have electronic transition energies in the ultraviolet region. Recent standard method for generating such entangled photons is a chirped quasi-phase-matching method, however this method is not suitable for the generation of ultraviolet frequency-entangled photons because it requires down-conversion of a photon with a wavelength shorter than ultraviolet into an entangled photon pair. Here we propose a simple method for generating broadband ultraviolet frequency-entangled photons using cavity quantum plasmonics, in which conventional cavity quantum electrodynamics theory is applied to quantum plasmonics. We introduce a cavity-plasmon system in which localised surface plasmon (LSP) is coupled to the cavity fields of a state-of-the-art microcavity. Using this system, we theoretically show that broadband ultraviolet frequency-entangled photons can be generated simply by utilising the absorption saturation effect of LSP.},

This device emits light into the two modes entangled in the number of photons. The process is a prime example of losses changing from being a nuisance into something beneficial, since, although it is counterintuitive, the entanglement is enabled by strong incoherent processes, i.e., the dominant scattering and absorption rates of the nanoantenna. This renders the nanoantenna an active source of nonclassicality. Both the high emission rate and the degree of entanglement of the emitted light are insensitive with respect to imperfections in the nanoantenna length, rendering the scheme feasible for an implementation.},

	Abstract = {Currently, epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials have become important for controlling the propagation of light and enhancing by several orders of magnitude the Kerr and other nonlinearities. Given this advance it is important to examine the quantum electrodynamic processes and information tasks near ENZ materials. We study the entanglement between two two-level systems near ENZ materials and compare our results with the case where the ENZ material is replaced by a metal. It is shown that with ENZ materials substantial entanglement can be achieved over larger distances than for metal films. We show that this entanglement over large distances is due to the fact that one can not only have large emission rates but also large energy transmission rates at the epsilon-near-zero wavelength. This establishes the superiority of ENZ materials for studying processes specifically important for quantum information tasks.},

	Abstract = {A graphene wrapped dielectric particle has been proposed theoretically to realize tunable multi-qubit quantum phase gates (QPGs) with ultrahigh fidelity. By using a first-principles Green's function technique, the interactions between quantum emitters mediated by graphene plasmons have been investigated. We find that the spontaneous decay rates of these emitters can be strongly enhanced and controlled by means of the efficient excitations of eigenmodes in graphene. The collective subradiance and superradiance resulting from the graphene-mediated interactions have been predicted. Based on these phenomena, we propose the tunable multi-qubit QPGs. These phase gates have the advantage of sensitive adjustability by changing the Fermi level or the electrostatic gating in graphene, at the same time they possess very high fidelities due to the small dissipation in the graphene monolayer.},

	Abstract = {Optical nanoantennas have shown a great capacity for efficient extraction of photons from the near to the far field, enabling directional emission from nanoscale single-photon sources. However, their potential for the generation and extraction of multi-photon quantum states remains unexplored. Here we experimentally demonstrate the nanoscale generation of two-photon quantum states at telecommunication wavelengths based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an optical nanoantenna. The antenna is a crystalline AlGaAs nanocylinder, possessing Mie-type resonances at both the pump and the bi-photon wavelengths, and when excited by a pump beam it generates photon pairs with a rate of 35 Hz. Normalized to the pump energy stored by the nanoantenna, this rate corresponds to 1.4 GHz/Wm, being 1 order of magnitude higher than conventional on-chip or bulk photon-pair sources. Our experiments open the way for multiplexing several antennas for coherent generation of multi-photon quantum states with complex spatial-mode entanglement and applications in free-space quantum communications and sensing.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein?protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ? 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The evolution of polaritons into solitons is highlighted. A detailed review of nonlinear plasmonics is then given that includes field enhancement of localized surface plasmons and controlling light with light. Switching and modulation of surface plasmon-polariton signals are then reviewed. After a discussion of nonlinear plasmonic crystals, and structured metal surfaces, some comments on metamaterials are also included.

	Abstract = {Plasmonic nanoantennas provide unprecedented opportunities to concentrate light fields in subwavelength-sized volumes. By placing a nonlinear dielectric nanoparticle in such a hot spot, one can hope to take advantage of both the field enhancement provided by nanoantennas and the large, nonlinear optical susceptibility of dielectric nanoparticles. To test this concept, we combine gold gap nanoantennas with second-order, nonlinear zinc sulfide nanoparticles, and perform second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy on the combined hybrid dielectric/plasmonic nanoantennas as well as on the individual constituents. We find that SHG from the bare gold nanoantennas, even though it should be forbidden due to symmetry reasons, is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the bare zinc sulfide nanoparticles. Even stronger second harmonic signals are generated by the hybrid dielectric/plasmonic nanoantennas. Control experiments with nanoantennas containing linear lanthanum fluoride nanoparticles reveal; however, that the increased SHG efficiency of the hybrid dielectric/plasmonic nanoantennas does not depend on the nonlinear optical susceptibility of the dielectric nanoparticles but is an effect of the modification of the dielectric environment. The combination of a hybrid dielectric/plasmonic nanoantenna, which is only resonant for the incoming pump light field, with a second nanoantenna, which is resonant for the generated second harmonic light, allows for a further increase in the efficiency of SHG. As the second nanoantenna mediates the coupling of the second harmonic light to the far field, this double-resonant approach also provides us with control over the polarization of the generated light. INTRODUCTION Since the pioneering experiments of H. Hertz and G. Marconi, anten-nas have been essential tools for the manipulation of electromagnetic waves 1,2 . Thus far, antennas have been mainly used for radio and microwave applications, e.g., as components of wireless communica-tion systems or for object detection and ranging 3 . The development of high precision nano-fabrication techniques has additionally revealed promising possibilities for antennas in the optical domain. For instance, one can nowadays fabricate nanometer-sized metallic nano-structures that exhibit resonances in the near infrared and even in the visible spectral regime 4--6 . Like their counterparts in the radio or microwave regime, these so-called plasmonic nanoantennas can be used to funnel-free propagating waves into volumes far smaller than the diffraction limit and vice versa 4--7 . This results in an enormous intensity enhancement for a resonant incoming light field and pro-vides an enhanced far-field coupling for nanoscale light sources. One class of optical processes with a strong demand for high intens-ities is the class of nonlinear optical frequency conversion processes 5,8 . The most prominent among them are second harmonic generation (SHG) and parametric down-conversion in noncentrosymmetric bulk crystals (noncentrosymmetry is a necessary condition for electric dipole allowed second-order nonlinear optical processes, see, e.g., Boyd 8 , which are both widely used for the generation of high power, coherent, tunable radiation, from the ultraviolet up to the mid-infra-red range 9--11 . Through an increased demand for subwavelength coherent light sources, an interest in subwavelength frequency con-version schemes has also emerged 12--19 . A simple approach could be to directly use nanometer-sized nonlinear dielectric crystals for fre-quency conversion applications. However, the efficiency of these pro-cesses is a superlinear function of the volume of the employed crystals 20 . Therefore, nonlinear frequency conversion processes based on such nonlinear dielectric nanocrystals are intrinsically very weak. A strategy to overcome the poor conversion efficiency of nonlinear dielectric nanocrystals could be to place the nanocrystals in the hot spots of plasmonic nanoantennas so that one can take advantage of both the plasmonic field-enhancement effect and the large nonlinear optical susceptibility of the dielectric nanoparticles. In several experi-ments on SHG 21--23 and third harmonic generation (THG) 24,25 from such hybrid plasmonic/dielectric nanoantennas, an enhancement of the nonlinear efficiency of the hybrid dielectric/plasmonic nanoanten-nas compared to that of the corresponding bare, nonlinear dielectric nanocrystals was indeed observed. These findings apparently support the idea behind the aforementioned strategy, i.e., the increase in the nonlinear signal is caused by a combination of plasmonic field enhance-ment and a large dielectric nonlinear susceptibility. However, a recent experimental study on THG from gap nanoantennas containing},

Rather than correct ellipsometric results for the pres- ence of overlayers, we have removed these layers as far as possible using the real-time capa- bility of the spectroscopic ellipsometer to assess surface quality during cleaning. Our results are compared with previous data. In general, there is good agreement among optical parameters measured on smooth, clean, and undamaged samples maintained in an inert at- mosphere regardless of the technique used to obtain the data. Differences among our data and previous results can generally be understood in terms of inadequate sample preparation, although results obtained by Kramers-Kronig analysis of reflectance measurements often show effects due to improper extrapolations. The present results illustrate the importance of proper sample preparation and of the capability of separately determining both el and e2 in optical measurements.},

Because silicon is a centrosymmetric material, the studies of nonlinear optical properties of silicon nanoparticles have been targeting primarily the third-harmonic generation effects. Here we demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that resonantly excited nanocrystalline silicon nanoparticles fabricated by an optimized laser printing technique can exhibit strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) effects. We attribute an unexpectedly high yield of the nonlinear conversion to a nanocrystalline structure of nanoparticles supporting the Mie resonances.
